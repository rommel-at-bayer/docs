OKR: 
Increase the number of regions utilizing the experience platform

Scope
Packaging capabilities with features needed to work with any market
Harmonizing shared tooling and functionality across the FX space (logging, error handling, data fetching, etc.)
Add tooling and generators to setup new capabilities and integrations within the FX repositories
Setting up playbooks for capabilities to extend their features to all markets
Setup patterns to increase visibility into capabilities that has already been registered in FX platform
Ensure capabilities can be reused for other countries

Explanation :
Document a pattern that decides on what makes up a capability and catalog existing ones so that other can leverage them.
Based on these pattern we decide whether a capability can be shared with other countries
If yes we share
If not we should come up with a plan to make them ready
create terms that make sense for current capabilities and platform ready capabilities
Select a couple of capabilities and make them ready.
Measure how many capabilities are ready
Measure how many capabilities are used by each country
Create a tool that helps to create a new capability
This tool should create a skeleton structure that has all the basic necessities that makes up a capability.
This tool can also help to enhance an existing capability to make it ready.
Determine a good pattern for logging, error handling, data fetching
Some thoughts: Override the default pattern(eg: console.log) so that any capability logging them will have same output.
Determine how/where we should register them ?
Document all these new tools and patterns


Capture and package existing Farmer Experience capabilities

* Document existing capabilities

* Determine which capabilities are used/could be used by more than one country

* Consolidate shared capabilities into packages


Implement shared tooling for maturing capabilities

* Implement packaged tools

Setup playbook for registering capabilities into FX platform

* Setup playbook
