Override Priority Order

process.env
.env.[environment]
.env

When you need environment variables

Local Development
Build Time (Local + CI/CD)
Runtime (Local + CI/CD)

Vault Source 
of Truth 
(Github 
Actions)

Spectrum Source 
of Truth 
(spectrum.config)

Application 
Source of 
Truth (.env)



Future State:
Spectrum file is the source of truth
Use spectrum to generate env files to run and build 
the application both locally and when deploying it
Add NEXT_PUBLIC envs to spectrum file
Write a script to read all the envs from the spectrum 
file and use in the build and deploy
When running locally and want to generate a .env file 
or set local environment variables, use the vault 
token to read the values in vault. If the user does not 
have the permissions to read from vault, then it will 
put blanks or leave out those env variables.
.env can be modified to have envs locally overriden 
if needed
we will remove .env files from github
spectrum should have the ability to pass an output 
path for where to write the .env file
